# Loan Data from Prosper
## by Jianmei Bai


## Dataset

> I chose Loan Data from Prosper for this project. This dataset contains 
113,937 rows and 81 columns. I explored the data to check what are the factors that could affect borrowerâ€™s APR and monthly payment.


## Summary of Findings

> I performed univariate exploration, bivariate exploration, and multivariate exploration to the dataset. The increase of credit score range, prosper score or loan original amount leads to decrease of borrower APR. 
The higher the loan original amount, the more monthly loan payment the borrower needs to pay.
With the same employment status, the borrower APR decreases with higher prosper score.
## Key Insights for Presentation

> 
Multiple plots were explored to look at the factors that may affect the borrower APR and the monthly loan payment.  As the CreditScoreRangeLower goes higher, the people with the same prosper score have lower borrower APR. With the same employment status, the borrower APR decreases with higher prosper score.
